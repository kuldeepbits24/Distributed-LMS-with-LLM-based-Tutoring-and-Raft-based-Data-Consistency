# AI-Powered Learning Management System (LMS)

This project implements an AI-driven Learning Management System (LMS) with advanced functionalities such as distributed consensus, tutoring services via COHERE, and user role-based operations. The system leverages gRPC for communication, supports Raft consensus for consistency, and integrates GUI and CLI interfaces for user interaction.

## Features

- **Distributed Consensus**: Implements the Raft algorithm for leader election and log replication across nodes.
- **Tutoring Services**: Connects to a COHERE-based server for answering student queries.
- **User Roles**: Distinct functionalities for students and instructors:
  - Students: Submit assignments, view grades, and post queries.
  - Instructors: Post assignments, view and grade assignments, and respond to queries.
- **GUI and CLI Interfaces**: Interactive user interfaces for ease of access.
- **Dynamic Session Management**: Secure login and logout with session tokens.

## Architecture

The project includes the following key components:

1. **LMS Leader Server**: Manages the Raft leader functionalities.
2. **LMS Follower Server**: Handles follower node responsibilities and participates in elections.
3. **Tutoring Server**: COHERE-powered service for answering student queries.
4. **LMS Client**: CLI-based interface for user interactions.
5. **LMS GUI**: Tkinter-based graphical interface for enhanced user experience.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- grpcio
- grpcio-tools
- transformers
- torch
- `grpcio` and `grpcio-tools`
- `transformers` library
- Other Python dependencies: Install using `requirements.txt`
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- to install LLM COHERE:  python -m pip install cohere --upgrade

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   cd ai-lms-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

#### 1. Start the Servers
- **Leader Node_2:
  ```bash
  python lms_server_leader.py
  ```
- **Follower Nodes_3:
  ```bash
  python lms_server_follower.py
  ```
- **Follower Nodes_4:
  ```bash
  python lms_server_follower.py
  ```
- **Tutoring Server NODE_1:
  ```bash
  python tutoring_server.py
  ```

#### 2. Run the Client (You can run client on any node)
- CLI:
  ```bash
  python lms_client.py
  ```
- GUI:
  ```bash
  python lms_gui.py
  ```

## Usage

### CLI Options
- Login or register as a student or instructor.
- Perform role-specific actions such as submitting assignments or grading assignments.

### GUI Options
- Navigate through interactive menus for actions like posting queries or viewing grades.
- Ask -COHERE-powered tutoring questions.

## Future Enhancements
